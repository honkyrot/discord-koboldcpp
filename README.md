# discord-koboldcpp
An attempt to use the **[koboldcpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp)** API with a simple discord chatbot.<br>
This is very much a work in progress, and made for fun.<br>
responds only to the bot name you give it or @\<bot\>.<br>

## Usage
Clone or copy the repository.<br>
Rename the `.env.example` to `.env` and change its parameters.<br>
On the target computer, run koboldcpp and THEN the main.py file.<br>

## Note
Your mileage may vary depending on your Large Language Model, instruct prompts, and samples, please adjust them accordingly to your liking.<br>
Personally, I don't recommend models tuned on roleplay if you want a general chatbot, but you do you.<br>
Best used if you have knowledge on Python, AI LLMs, instruct mode, and koboldcpp.<br>
